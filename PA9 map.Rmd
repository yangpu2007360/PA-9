## R Markdown and leaflet assignment

Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r icon}
library(leaflet)
ciscoIcon <- makeIcon(
iconUrl = "http://www.cisco.com/web/fw/i/logo-open-graph.gif", 
iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)

ciscoLatLong <- data.frame(
lat = c(37.412577, 37.410776, 37.430788),
lng = c(-121.917040, -121.924144, -121.924145))

ciscoLatLong %>%
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(icon = ciscoIcon)
```
